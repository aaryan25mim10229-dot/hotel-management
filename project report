1. Introduction
This project is developed as part of the flipped course evaluation under the “Build Your Own Project” initiative.
The main objective is to enable students to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world problem by designing, implementing, and documenting a complete working system.
________________________________________
2. Problem Statement
The project aims to solve a specific identified problem by offering a functional technical solution. The problem is analysed from the perspective of user needs, workflow inefficiencies, or automation requirements.
________________________________________
3. Functional Requirements
The system includes at least three major functional modules, such as:
1.	User Management
2.	Data Input & Processing
3.	Reporting / Output Generation
Each module has a clear input-output flow, ensuring a logical user interaction process.
________________________________________
4. Non-functional Requirements
The project includes a minimum of four NFRs:
•	Performance: Low-latency operations
•	Usability: Simple and intuitive interface
•	Security: Basic validation and safe operations
•	Reliability: Handles errors gracefully
•	Maintainability: Modular and readable code
•	Scalability: Flexible to add more features later
________________________________________
5. System Architecture
A modular architecture is used, consisting of:
•	Presentation Layer
•	Logic/Processing Layer
•	Storage/Memory Layer (if applicable)
________________________________________
6. Design Decisions & Rationale
•	Logical separation of modules
•	Use of chosen language/framework for efficiency
•	Validation design to ensure reliable operations
•	Diagrams selected for clarity in documentation
________________________________________
7. Implementation Details
•	Code structured across 5–10 meaningful modules/files
•	Input validation included
•	Error handling and messaging
•	Version control used throughout development
________________________________________
8. Testing Approach
•	Manual testing on all functional modules
•	Validation tests for inputs
•	Workflow consistency testing
________________________________________
9. Challenges Faced
•	Identifying an appropriate architecture
•	Creating UML diagrams
•	Ensuring functional flow remains logical
________________________________________
10. Learnings & Key Takeaways
•	Practical application of course concepts
•	Importance of documentation
•	Steps for designing system architecture
•	Improved problem-solving and coding discipline
________________________________________
11. Future Enhancements
•	Adding more advanced modules
•	Integrating database storage
•	Implementing advanced analytics / automation
